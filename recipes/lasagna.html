        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a delicious and hearty Italian dish that is loved by many. It is a layered pasta casserole made with wide sheets of pasta, typically layered with a rich tomato-based sauce, cheese, and various fillings. The recipe starts by preparing a flavorful meat sauce, which is made by browning ground beef or a combination of beef and Italian sausage with onions, garlic, and herbs. Once the meat is cooked, tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes are added, along with seasonings like oregano, basil, and a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity. The sauce simmers and develops its flavors while you prepare the other components. The pasta sheets are boiled until al dente, then layered in a baking dish with alternating layers of the meat sauce, a creamy cheese mixture (usually a combination of ricotta, Parmesan, and mozzarella), and sometimes other fillings like saut√©ed vegetables or sliced cooked Italian sausage. The layers are repeated until the dish is filled, and it is then topped with more sauce and cheese. The lasagna bakes in the oven until golden and bubbly, allowing the flavors to meld together and the cheese to melt and become gooey. It is often served hot, straight from the oven, with a side of garlic bread or a fresh green salad. Lasagna is a comforting and satisfying meal that is perfect for gatherings or a cozy family dinner.</p>
