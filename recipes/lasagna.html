        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a delicious and hearty Italian dish that is loved by many. It is a layered pasta casserole made with wide sheets of pasta, typically layered with a rich tomato-based sauce, cheese, and various fillings. The recipe starts by preparing a flavorful meat sauce, which is made by browning ground beef or a combination of beef and Italian sausage with onions, garlic, and herbs. Once the meat is cooked, tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes are added, along with seasonings like oregano, basil, and a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity. The sauce simmers and develops its flavors while you prepare the other components. The pasta sheets are boiled until al dente, then layered in a baking dish with alternating layers of the meat sauce, a creamy cheese mixture (usually a combination of ricotta, Parmesan, and mozzarella), and sometimes other fillings like sautéed vegetables or sliced cooked Italian sausage. The layers are repeated until the dish is filled, and it is then topped with more sauce and cheese. The lasagna bakes in the oven until golden and bubbly, allowing the flavors to meld together and the cheese to melt and become gooey. It is often served hot, straight from the oven, with a side of garlic bread or a fresh green salad. Lasagna is a comforting and satisfying meal that is perfect for gatherings or a cozy family dinner.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles (oven-ready or boiled until al dente)</li>
            <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef or a combination of beef and Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cans (14 ounces each) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and sauté until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the ground beef (or beef and Italian sausage mixture) to the skillet, breaking it up with a spoon. Cook until the meat is browned and fully cooked. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, dried oregano, dried basil, sugar, salt, and pepper. Allow the sauce to simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, so the flavors can meld together. Adjust the seasonings to taste.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, and egg. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly incorporated.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange three lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping them.</li>
                <li>Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of any optional fillings you desire (e.g., sautéed vegetables or sliced cooked Italian sausage).</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers: meat sauce, noodles, cheese mixture, and fillings. You can repeat this process 2-3 times, depending on the depth of your baking dish, until all the ingredients are used.</li>
                <li>End with a final layer of meat sauce on top, making sure to cover the noodles completely. Sprinkle additional shredded mozzarella cheese on top for a cheesy crust.</li>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired, and serve hot. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
