    <h3>Descrpition</h3>
    <p>Chicken Piccata is a delightful Italian dish that features tender chicken breasts cooked in a tangy and flavorful lemon-caper sauce. The dish typically starts by lightly coating chicken cutlets in seasoned flour and then saut√©ing them in a skillet until they turn golden brown and develop a crispy exterior. The chicken is then set aside, and a luscious sauce is prepared in the same skillet. The sauce is made by combining chicken broth, lemon juice, and white wine, which is simmered to reduce and concentrate the flavors. Capers are added to the sauce, lending a briny and zesty taste. The chicken is placed back into the skillet with the sauce, allowing it to soak up the flavors and continue cooking until fully tender and cooked through. Chicken Piccata is often served over a bed of pasta or with a side of steamed vegetables, allowing you to enjoy every delicious bite of the succulent chicken and the vibrant flavors of the sauce. It's a dish that perfectly balances the richness of the chicken with the brightness of the lemon and capers, resulting in a mouthwatering and satisfying meal.</p>
