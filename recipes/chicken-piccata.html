    <h3>Descrpition</h3>
    <p>Chicken Piccata is a delightful Italian dish that features tender chicken breasts cooked in a tangy and flavorful lemon-caper sauce. The dish typically starts by lightly coating chicken cutlets in seasoned flour and then sautéing them in a skillet until they turn golden brown and develop a crispy exterior. The chicken is then set aside, and a luscious sauce is prepared in the same skillet. The sauce is made by combining chicken broth, lemon juice, and white wine, which is simmered to reduce and concentrate the flavors. Capers are added to the sauce, lending a briny and zesty taste. The chicken is placed back into the skillet with the sauce, allowing it to soak up the flavors and continue cooking until fully tender and cooked through. Chicken Piccata is often served over a bed of pasta or with a side of steamed vegetables, allowing you to enjoy every delicious bite of the succulent chicken and the vibrant flavors of the sauce. It's a dish that perfectly balances the richness of the chicken with the brightness of the lemon and capers, resulting in a mouthwatering and satisfying meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
   
        <li>1 1/2 pounds, skinless chicken breast halves, or 4 to 8 chicken cutlets</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup low-sodium chicken stock, or dry white wine (such as a Sauvignon Blanc)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup capers, drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing the chicken breasts. Place them between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them to an even thickness, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a shallow dish, combine flour with salt and pepper. Dredge each chicken breast in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted and the skillet is hot, add the chicken breasts. Cook them for about 3-4 minutes on each side until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and white wine. Bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits.</li>
        <li>Let the sauce simmer for a couple of minutes until it slightly reduces. Stir in the capers and continue simmering for another minute.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet, nestling them into the sauce. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the chicken to absorb some of the flavors.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat. Transfer the chicken breasts to a serving platter or individual plates.
        If desired, you can thicken the sauce further by whisking in a tablespoon of butter until melted and smooth. Pour the sauce over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and lemon slices, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve the Chicken Piccata immediately with your choice of sides, such as pasta, rice, or steamed vegetables. Enjoy the flavorful and tangy Chicken Piccata!</li>
