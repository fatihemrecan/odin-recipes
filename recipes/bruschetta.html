    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bruschetta is a popular Italian appetizer that consists of grilled bread topped with a flavorful mixture of fresh tomatoes, garlic, basil, and olive oil. The dish originated in central Italy and has become beloved worldwide for its simplicity and vibrant flavors. To prepare bruschetta, slices of crusty bread, such as baguette or ciabatta, are toasted or grilled until crispy on the outside and still slightly soft on the inside. The bread is then rubbed with a clove of garlic to infuse it with a subtle garlic flavor. The topping is typically made by combining diced ripe tomatoes, minced garlic, chopped fresh basil, olive oil, salt, and pepper. The tomato mixture is generously spooned over the toasted bread, allowing the bread to soak up the flavors of the tomatoes and herbs. Bruschetta can be enjoyed as an appetizer or a light snack, and it is often served at gatherings or as a starter before a meal. Its simplicity and bright, fresh flavors make it a delightful and refreshing dish that captures the essence of Italian cuisine.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Baguette or ciabatta bread, sliced into thick slices</li>
        <li>Ripe tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) or preheat a grill or stovetop griddle.</li>
        <li>Slice the baguette or ciabatta bread into thick slices, approximately ½ to ¾ inch thick.</li>
        <li>Place the bread slices on a baking sheet or directly on the grill or griddle.</li>
        <li>Toast the bread until it becomes crispy and slightly golden. If using the oven, it usually takes about 5-7 minutes. If using a grill or griddle, cook the bread for about 2-3 minutes per side. Watch it closely to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>While the bread is toasting, prepare the tomato topping. In a bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, minced garlic, chopped fresh basil, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Gently toss to combine all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Once the bread slices are toasted, remove them from the oven, grill, or griddle. Optional: You can rub a peeled garlic clove over the surface of the bread to add a subtle garlic flavor.</li>
        <li>Spoon the tomato mixture generously over each slice of bread, ensuring that the topping covers the bread evenly.</li>
        <li>Serve the bruschetta immediately as an appetizer or snack. It can be enjoyed as is or paired with additional toppings or accompaniments such as mozzarella cheese, balsamic glaze, or a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Enjoy it!</li>
