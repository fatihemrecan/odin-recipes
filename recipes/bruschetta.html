    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bruschetta is a popular Italian appetizer that consists of grilled bread topped with a flavorful mixture of fresh tomatoes, garlic, basil, and olive oil. The dish originated in central Italy and has become beloved worldwide for its simplicity and vibrant flavors. To prepare bruschetta, slices of crusty bread, such as baguette or ciabatta, are toasted or grilled until crispy on the outside and still slightly soft on the inside. The bread is then rubbed with a clove of garlic to infuse it with a subtle garlic flavor. The topping is typically made by combining diced ripe tomatoes, minced garlic, chopped fresh basil, olive oil, salt, and pepper. The tomato mixture is generously spooned over the toasted bread, allowing the bread to soak up the flavors of the tomatoes and herbs. Bruschetta can be enjoyed as an appetizer or a light snack, and it is often served at gatherings or as a starter before a meal. Its simplicity and bright, fresh flavors make it a delightful and refreshing dish that captures the essence of Italian cuisine.</p>
